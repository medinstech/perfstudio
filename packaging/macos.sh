# The spec builds `dist/PerfStudio.app`; this is only the delivery.  A .dmg is what a Mac
# user expects to download -- it opens to a window with the application on one side and a
# shortcut to /Applications on the other, and installing is dragging one onto the other.
# There is nothing to run and nothing to uninstall afterwards but the folder itself.
#
# What this cannot do is make the first launch pleasant.  The bundle is signed ad-hoc,
# which is the minimum Apple Silicon will execute at all, but it is not signed with a
# Developer ID and it is not notarized -- so Gatekeeper stops it once and the user has to
# allow it by hand.  See docs/RELEASING.md: that is a certificate away, not a rewrite.

# here already, and re-signing over it with `--deep` is the documented way to break the
# nested ones.  This says what is actually on the thing that is about to ship.
#
# And it is allowed to stop the build: `set -e` and `pipefail` are still in force, so an
# unsigned or broken bundle fails here rather than on somebody else's Mac, where the
# symptom is an application that will not open and no reason given.
